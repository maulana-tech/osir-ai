## About Osir AI

Osir AI is an open-source, self-hostable social media management platform built for creators, agencies and SMBs. It does what Sendible, SocialPilot, or ContentStudio do, but free and without per-seat, per-channel, or per-workspace limits. Plan, compose, schedule, approve, publish, and monitor content across Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok, YouTube, Pinterest, Threads, Bluesky, Google Business Profile, Mastodon, and DEV.to from a single multi-workspace dashboard.

**New: the Osir AI Autopilot.** A [Strands Agents](https://strandsagents.com) agent (in [`agent/`](agent/)) runs the workspace in the background on Amazon Bedrock AgentCore: it answers routine comments and DMs, fills empty posting slots with drafts from your idea board, and writes the weekly digest. It only pings you when there is a real decision to make, through the approval queue and notifications you already use. See [agent/README.md](agent/README.md).

It's for people managing many client accounts under one roof who'd rather own their social stack than pay $100–300/month to a SaaS vendor. Every feature is available to every user. No paid tier, no feature gate, no upsell.

Run it on your own VPS via Docker, or run it locally. All platform integrations talk directly to the official first-party APIs using your own developer credentials, so there's no aggregator middleman, no vendor lock-in, and no third party sitting between you and your data.

## Features

| | |
|---|---|
| **Multi-workspace & teams** | Unlimited orgs → workspaces → members. Granular RBAC with custom roles, invitations, and a separate Client role for external collaborators. |
| **Content composer** | Rich editor with per-platform caption/media overrides, version history, reusable templates, content categories & tags, a Kanban idea board. |
| **Calendar & scheduling** | Visual calendar with recurring weekly posting slots per account and named queues that auto-assign posts to the next available slot. |
| **Publishing engine** | Direct first-party API integrations (no aggregator), automatic retries, per-account rate-limit tracking, and a 90-day publish audit log. |
| **Approval workflows** | Configurable stages (none / optional / internal / internal + client), threaded internal & external comments, reminders, and a full audit trail. |
| **Unified social inbox** | Comments, mentions, DMs, and reviews from every connected platform in one place, with sentiment analysis, assignments, threaded replies, and historical backfill. |
| **Analytics** | Per-post and channel-level performance from every connected platform's native API, with KPI cards, 7/30/90-day trend charts, and a sortable all-posts table for views, engagement, follower growth, reach, and watch time. |
| **Media library** | Org- and workspace-scoped libraries with nested folders, auto-generated platform-optimized variants, alt text, and built-in Unsplash stock-photo search in the composer. |
| **Client portal** | Passwordless 30-day magic-link access so clients can approve or reject posts without creating an account. |
| **Notifications** | In-app, email, and webhook delivery with per-user preferences for every event type. |
| **Security & ops** | Encrypted token & credential storage, Google SSO, Sentry support, and a 14-day reversible org-deletion grace period. 2FA (TOTP) is on the roadmap. |
| **White-label friendly** | Per-workspace branding (logo, colors) and workspace defaults for hashtags, first comments, and posting templates. |

## Quick Start (Docker)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maulana-tech/osir-ai.git
cd osir-ai
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` - change `DATABASE_URL` to point to the Docker service name:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/osir_ai
```

Then start everything:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose exec app python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Database migrations run automatically via the `migrate` Compose service before
the `app` and `worker` services start, so there is no separate migrate step.

Tailwind compiles automatically via the `tailwind` Compose service. First build
takes ~60–90 seconds (running `npm install` in a fresh container); subsequent
starts are instant. Watch progress with `docker compose logs -f tailwind`.

Open http://localhost:8000 - you're running.

The Compose file also starts the **web UI** (`web/`, Next.js) on http://localhost:3000.
Sign in there: it proxies `/accounts/`, `/api/`, OAuth and the remaining Django pages to
Studio, so the browser sees one origin and one session. To run the agent's command worker
in Docker too, add `STUDIO_API_KEY` and your AWS credentials to `.env` and start the
`agent` profile:

```bash
docker compose --profile agent up -d
```

In production (`make docker-prod`), Caddy serves everything on `APP_DOMAIN`: Django paths
(`/api/`, `/accounts/`, `/social-accounts/`, `/workspace/` …, see `Caddyfile`) go to the
`app` container and everything else to the Next.js `console` container. Include `app` plus
your domain in `ALLOWED_HOSTS`.


## Fully Local Development (without Docker)

Run everything natively - no Docker, no PostgreSQL install. Uses SQLite for the database.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Node.js 20+

### Setup

**1. Clone and configure**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maulana-tech/osir-ai.git
cd osir-ai
cp .env.example .env
```

**2. Switch to SQLite**

Open `.env` and replace the `DATABASE_URL` line:

```
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3
```

That's it - no database server to install or manage.

**3. Set up Python**

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Set up Tailwind CSS**

```bash
cd theme/static_src
npm install
cd ../..
```

**5. Run database migrations**

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

**6. Create your admin account**

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

**7. Start the app (3 terminal tabs)**

Tab 1 - Tailwind watcher:
```bash
cd theme/static_src && npm run start
```

Tab 2 - Django dev server:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python manage.py runserver
```

Tab 3 - Background worker:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python manage.py process_tasks
```

Open http://localhost:8000 and log in with the superuser you created.

### Daily workflow (Docker-free)

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate                # activate Python env
python manage.py runserver               # start web server
# (open another tab)
python manage.py process_tasks           # start worker
```

> **Note:** SQLite is fine for local development and small deployments. For production or heavy concurrent usage, switch to PostgreSQL.

## Running Tests

```bash
pytest
```

With coverage:

```bash
pytest --cov=apps --cov-report=term-missing
```

## Linting & Type Checking

```bash
ruff check .                             # lint
ruff format --check .                    # format check
mypy apps/ config/ --ignore-missing-imports  # type check
```

Auto-fix lint issues:

```bash
ruff check --fix .
ruff format .
```

## Production Deployment

### Docker Compose on a VPS (recommended)

```bash
# On your server:
git clone https://github.com/maulana-tech/osir-ai.git
cd osir-ai
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env:
#   SECRET_KEY=<generate a random 50+ char string>
#   DEBUG=false
#   ALLOWED_HOSTS=yourdomain.com
#   APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
#   DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:<strong-password>@postgres:5432/osir_ai

docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
docker compose exec app python manage.py createsuperuser
```

This starts 5 containers: app (Gunicorn), worker, PostgreSQL, Caddy (auto-HTTPS), and a one-shot migrate container that runs database migrations automatically on startup. Edit the `Caddyfile` with your domain.

To update:

```bash
git pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

> **Settings selection:** The `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable controls which settings file Django uses. The defaults are already wired for each context: `manage.py` uses `development`, `wsgi.py`/`asgi.py` use `production`, and `pytest` uses `test` (via `pyproject.toml`). Docker Compose files also set it explicitly. You only need to override it manually if you want a non-default module for a specific command, e.g. `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings.production python manage.py check --deploy`.

## Platform Credentials

### No developer app? Connect through Composio

Registering a developer app with every platform is the slowest part of setup. As a fallback, Osir AI can hand the login to [Composio](https://composio.dev): set `COMPOSIO_API_KEY` and one Composio-managed auth config id per toolkit (`COMPOSIO_AUTH_CONFIG_LINKEDIN`, `_FACEBOOK`, `_INSTAGRAM`, `_YOUTUBE`, `_PINTEREST`), and every platform the org has **no** own credentials for shows "Connect via Composio" instead of "Not configured".

Precedence never changes: `.env` platform keys, then the org's Platform Credentials page, then Composio. Accounts connected through Composio hold no tokens in Studio; every platform call is proxied by Composio, which injects and refreshes the token. Facebook Pages and Instagram-via-Facebook are the exception: the Page token the platform returns is stored and used directly, so they behave like own-app accounts after login. TikTok, Threads, Bluesky, Mastodon, Google Business and DEV.to have no Composio-managed OAuth and keep their existing flows.

To connect social media accounts, you need API credentials from each platform's developer portal. You can set these via environment variables in `.env` (see `.env.example`) or, per organization, through the Django admin at `{APP_URL}/admin/` → **Credentials → Platform credentials** (superuser only). If a platform is configured in both places, the `.env` value takes precedence.

**Admin UI access (superuser only):** The Django admin at `{APP_URL}/admin/` (for example `https://osir.example.com/admin/`) is restricted to superuser accounts — only a superuser can view or edit platform credentials there. If you don't already have one, create a superuser, then sign in and open **Credentials → Platform credentials**:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
# Docker: docker compose exec app python manage.py createsuperuser
```

**Redirect URI:** When registering your app on any platform, set the OAuth redirect URI to:

```
{APP_URL}/social-accounts/callback/{platform}/
```

For example, if your `APP_URL` is `https://osir.example.com`, the Facebook redirect URI would be `https://osir.example.com/social-accounts/callback/facebook/`.

> **TikTok:** use the slug `social1` instead of `tiktok` — TikTok rejects redirect URIs containing their brand name. See the [TikTok](#tiktok) section.

### Meta (Facebook, Instagram, Threads)

Facebook and Instagram share the same Meta app credentials. Threads runs on the same Meta app but uses a **separate app identity** — its own App ID, App Secret, and redirect URI list (steps 6-7 below).

1. Go to [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/) and create a new app (type: **Business**)
2. Under **App Settings → Basic**, copy your **App ID** and **App Secret** — the plain ones, for Facebook and Instagram. Once the Threads use case is added this page also lists a **Threads App ID** / **Threads App Secret**; those are a different app identity and belong in the Threads variables in step 7, not here.
3. In the App Dashboard, go to **Use cases** and add the following four use cases. For each use case, click into it and go to **Permissions and features** to add the required optional permissions:

   **Use case: "Manage everything on your Page"** (Facebook)
   - This use case auto-includes `business_management`, `pages_show_list`, and `public_profile`
   - Add these optional permissions: `pages_manage_posts`, `pages_manage_engagement`, `pages_read_engagement`, `pages_read_user_content`, `pages_manage_metadata`, `read_insights`

   **Use case: "Messenger from Meta"** (Facebook Messaging)
   - Required to enable the `pages_messaging` permission, which is not available under the "Manage Pages" use case
   - Add the optional permission: `pages_messaging`

   **Use case: "Manage messaging & content on Instagram"** (Instagram)
   - Add these permissions: `instagram_basic`, `instagram_content_publish`, `instagram_manage_comments`, `instagram_manage_insights`

   **Use case: "Access the Threads API"** (Threads)
   - This use case auto-includes `threads_basic`
   - Add these optional permissions: `threads_content_publish`, `threads_manage_insights`, `threads_manage_replies`

4. Under **Facebook Login → Settings → Valid OAuth Redirect URIs**, add the following redirect URIs:
   ```
   {APP_URL}/social-accounts/callback/facebook/
   {APP_URL}/social-accounts/callback/instagram/
   ```
   > **Threads is separate.** Its callback does **not** belong here — the Threads use case keeps its own redirect URI list. See step 7.
5. **Webhooks (required for the inbox).** In the App Dashboard, go to **Webhooks** (also reachable via **Use cases → Manage everything on your Page → Webhooks**) and subscribe to the **Page** object:
   - **Callback URL:** `{APP_URL}/webhooks/facebook/`
   - **Verify token:** the value of `FACEBOOK_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN` from your `.env` (any random string; generate one and set the env var before clicking *Verify and save*)
   - After verification, subscribe to the `feed`, `mention`, and `messages` fields. `feed` is what carries comments on your Page's posts.

   > **This step is easy to miss and fails silently.** Connecting a Page subscribes it to your app automatically, so the account shows as healthy either way — but without the callback URL configured here, Meta never delivers anything. Comments then arrive only through the 5-minute polling fallback, and mentions not at all. Run `python manage.py diagnose_facebook --account-id <uuid>` to check.

   **If you connect Instagram through this Facebook app, also subscribe to the `Instagram` object** on the same Webhooks page:
   - **Callback URL:** `{APP_URL}/webhooks/facebook/` (the same endpoint — it handles both platforms)
   - Subscribe to the `comments` and `mentions` fields.

   > `comments` and `mentions` belong to the **Instagram** object, not the Page — a Page accepts only its own fields (`feed`, `mention`, `messages`, …). Studio subscribes the Instagram *account* automatically on connect, but the object-level configuration here can only be done in the dashboard. Without it, Instagram comments arrive only via the 5-minute poll and mentions not at all.
6. Set the environment variables:
   ```
   PLATFORM_FACEBOOK_APP_ID=your-app-id
   PLATFORM_FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET=your-app-secret
   FACEBOOK_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN=your-random-verify-token
   ```
7. **Threads:** the "Access the Threads API" use case gets its own App ID, App Secret, and redirect URIs. Go to **Use cases → Access the Threads API → Settings** and add the Threads redirect URI:
   ```
   {APP_URL}/social-accounts/callback/threads/
   ```
   Then copy the **Threads App ID** and **Threads App Secret** (also listed under **App settings → Basic**, alongside — and different from — your Facebook App ID) and set:
   ```
   PLATFORM_THREADS_APP_ID=your-threads-app-id
   PLATFORM_THREADS_APP_SECRET=your-threads-app-secret
   ```
   These have no fallback: until both are set, Threads shows as **Not Configured** on the connect page. Sending the Facebook App ID to Threads fails with error `4476002`.

### Instagram (Direct, via Instagram Login)

The Instagram (Direct) connector uses the **Instagram API with Instagram Login** - a separate OAuth flow from the Facebook Login-based Instagram connector above. It works with **Professional** Instagram accounts (Business or Creator) **without** requiring a linked Facebook Page.

> **Account-type requirement:** Personal Instagram accounts have no API access since the Instagram Basic Display API was retired on 2024-12-04. Users must convert their account to Professional first (free, in IG Settings → *Account type and tools* → *Switch to professional account*).

1. In the same Meta app, go to **Use cases** and add the **"Instagram API"** use case
2. Under **API setup with Instagram Login**, note your **Instagram App ID** and **Instagram App Secret** (these are different from your Facebook App ID/Secret)
3. Go to **Permissions and features** and add the required permissions:
   - `instagram_business_basic`, `instagram_business_content_publish`, `instagram_business_manage_comments`, `instagram_business_manage_messages`, `instagram_business_manage_insights`
4. Under **API setup with Instagram Login → Step 4: Set up Instagram business login**, click **Set up** and add the redirect URI (must match exactly, including the trailing slash):
   ```
   {APP_URL}/social-accounts/callback/instagram_login/
   ```
5. Under **API setup with Instagram Login → Step 3: Configure webhooks**, set:
   - **Callback URL:** `{APP_URL}/webhooks/instagram_login/`
   - **Verify token:** the value of `INSTAGRAM_LOGIN_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN` from your `.env` (any random string; generate one and set the env var before clicking Verify and save). After verification, subscribe to the `messages`, `comments`, and `mentions` fields.
6. Set the environment variables:
   ```
   PLATFORM_INSTAGRAM_APP_ID=your-instagram-app-id
   PLATFORM_INSTAGRAM_APP_SECRET=your-instagram-app-secret
   INSTAGRAM_LOGIN_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN=your-random-verify-token
   ```

### LinkedIn

Osir AI supports two LinkedIn paths. Pick whichever your LinkedIn dev app can obtain - or both, on separate apps.

**Path A - Personal-only (any individual developer can do this):**

1. Go to the [LinkedIn Developer Portal](https://developer.linkedin.com/) and create a new app (no Company Page verification required).
2. Under **Products**, request access to (both auto-approved):
   - **Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect**
   - **Share on LinkedIn**
3. Under **Auth**, add the redirect URI:
   ```
   {APP_URL}/social-accounts/callback/linkedin_personal/
   ```
4. Scopes: `openid`, `profile`, `email`, `w_member_social`.
5. Set the environment variables:
   ```
   PLATFORM_LINKEDIN_PERSONAL_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
   PLATFORM_LINKEDIN_PERSONAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
   ```

> **Limitations of Path A:** access tokens last ~60 days and LinkedIn does not issue refresh tokens for these scopes - users must manually reconnect every ~60 days. Inbox / comment-reading is not available for personal accounts on this path.

**Path B - Company Pages (also enables full Personal features):**

1. Go to the [LinkedIn Developer Portal](https://developer.linkedin.com/) and create a new app.
2. Verify the app's association with a LinkedIn Company Page.
3. Under **Products**, request access to:
   - **Community Management API** *(restricted - requires LinkedIn review)*
4. Under **Auth**, add **both** redirect URIs:
   ```
   {APP_URL}/social-accounts/callback/linkedin_personal/
   {APP_URL}/social-accounts/callback/linkedin_company/
   ```
5. Scopes:
   - **Personal:** `r_basicprofile`, `w_member_social`, `r_member_social`
   - **Company:** `r_basicprofile`, `w_member_social`, `w_organization_social`, `r_organization_social`, `rw_organization_admin`
6. Set the environment variables:
   ```
   PLATFORM_LINKEDIN_COMPANY_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
   PLATFORM_LINKEDIN_COMPANY_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
   ```

If you set only the Path B (Company) credentials, Osir AI automatically reuses them for personal connections too - refresh tokens (365-day) and inbox both work. You only need Path A vars if you have a separate Personal-only app.

> **Note:** "Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect" / "Share on LinkedIn" and "Community Management API" are **mutually exclusive** on a single LinkedIn app. You need separate apps for Path A and Path B.

> **Backwards compatibility:** the legacy `PLATFORM_LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID` / `PLATFORM_LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET` env vars are still honored as a fallback for both `linkedin_personal` and `linkedin_company` - existing self-hosters keep working without changes. The legacy credentials are assumed to be CM-approved; if your legacy app is OIDC-only, migrate it to `PLATFORM_LINKEDIN_PERSONAL_*`.

### TikTok

1. Go to the [TikTok Developer Portal](https://developers.tiktok.com/) and create a new app
2. Add the products **Login Kit** and **Content Posting API**
3. Configure the redirect URI — use `social1`, not `tiktok` (TikTok rejects URIs containing their brand name):
   ```
   {APP_URL}/social-accounts/callback/social1/
   ```
4. Required scopes: `user.info.basic`, `video.publish`, `video.upload`, `video.list`
5. Note: TikTok uses **Client Key** (not Client ID). Copy the **Client Key** and **Client Secret** from your app dashboard
6. Set the environment variables:
   ```
   PLATFORM_TIKTOK_CLIENT_KEY=your-client-key
   PLATFORM_TIKTOK_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
   ```
7. For production review, record the demo video against a TikTok **Sandbox** showing every requested scope in use.

### Google (YouTube, Google Business Profile)

YouTube and Google Business Profile share the same Google Cloud credentials.

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a new project (or select an existing one)
2. Enable the following APIs under **APIs & Services → Library**:
   - **YouTube Data API v3** (for YouTube)
   - **My Business Account Management API**, **My Business Business Information API**, and **Google My Business API** (for Google Business Profile)
3. Go to **APIs & Services → Credentials** and create an **OAuth 2.0 Client ID** (type: Web application)
4. Add the following redirect URIs under **Authorized redirect URIs**:
   ```
   {APP_URL}/social-accounts/callback/youtube/
   {APP_URL}/social-accounts/callback/google_business/
   ```
5. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

2. Go to **Settings → Privacy and Security → App Passwords**
3. Create a new app password and use it when connecting your account in Osir AI

### Mastodon

No developer app registration needed. Osir AI automatically registers an OAuth application on each Mastodon instance when a user connects their account. Users just need to enter their instance URL (e.g., `mastodon.social`).

### DEV.to

No developer app registration needed. Users connect by entering a personal **API key**:

1. Log in to [DEV.to](https://dev.to/) and open **[Settings → Extensions](https://dev.to/settings/extensions)**
2. Under **DEV Community API Keys**, enter a description (e.g. `Osir AI`) and click **Generate API Key**
3. Copy the generated key and paste it when connecting your account in Osir AI

Posts publish as DEV.to articles (title + Markdown body). The key can be revoked at any time from the same settings page.

## Inbox: Backfill Historical Messages

See the [Supported Platforms](#supported-platforms) matrix above for per-platform inbox capabilities.

To import historical messages (e.g., from the last 7 days):

```bash
python manage.py backfill_inbox --days 7
```

Options:
- `--days N` - Number of days to backfill (default: 7)
- `--platform NAME` - Only backfill a specific platform (e.g., `facebook`, `youtube`, `linkedin`, `tiktok`)
- `--account-id UUID` - Only backfill a specific account

For Facebook this recovers comments on the Page's posts from the last 30 days — useful after fixing a webhook that was never delivering, since comments missed while it was broken are otherwise invisible:

```bash
python manage.py backfill_inbox --platform facebook --days 30
```

## Inbox: Diagnosing a Facebook Page That Receives Nothing

When a Page's comments never reach the inbox, or a post's first comment never appears, the cause is usually a permission that was not granted or a webhook that was never configured — neither of which is visible from inside the app. Ask Meta directly:

```bash
python manage.py diagnose_facebook --account-id <uuid>
```

It reports the token's granted scopes (a missing `pages_manage_engagement` is why first comments fail), which app is subscribed to the Page and to which fields (`feed` is what carries comments), and whether comments are readable at all. Add `--subscribe` to repair a missing Page subscription in place, or `--json` for output to paste into an incident.

## API & MCP for Agents

Osir AI ships a REST API and an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server so agents and scripts can read analytics, manage media, and create or schedule posts. Both share the same authentication, permission model, rate limits, and audit log. Pick whichever protocol fits your client.

**Base URL:** `{APP_URL}/api/v1/` (e.g. `https://your-studio.example.com/api/v1/`)

### Authentication

Issue an API key from **Organization → API Keys**. Keys are workspace-scoped, can be allowlisted to specific social accounts, and inherit a subset of the issuer's workspace permissions. Revocation takes effect immediately. Send the key as a Bearer token:

```
Authorization: Bearer bb_studio_...
```

Permission keys: `create_posts`, `publish_directly`, `upload_media`, `view_analytics`. Each endpoint requires the relevant permission; missing permissions return `403`.

### Rate Limits

| Scope | Limit |
|---|---|
| Per-key writes | 120 / min |
| Per-key reads | 300 / min |
| Per-workspace aggregate | 1000 / min |

Rate-limit responses (`429`) include `Retry-After`, `X-RateLimit-Limit`, and `X-RateLimit-Remaining` headers.

### REST Endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose | Permission |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/me` | Inspect caller scope and workspace permissions | — |
| `GET` | `/accounts` | List connected social accounts | — |
| `POST` | `/posts` | Create a draft or scheduled post | `create_posts` (+ `publish_directly` to schedule) |
| `GET` | `/posts/{post_id}` | Read a single post | — |
| `PATCH` | `/posts/{post_id}` | Update draft fields | `create_posts` |
| `POST` | `/posts/{post_id}/schedule` | Schedule a draft | `create_posts` + `publish_directly` |
| `POST` | `/posts/{post_id}/cancel` | Revert a scheduled post to draft | `create_posts` |
| `GET` | `/analytics/accounts/{account_id}` | Channel analytics summary (7/30/90-day window) | `view_analytics` |
| `GET` | `/analytics/posts/{post_id}` | Post analytics with per-platform metrics | `view_analytics` |
| `POST` | `/media` | Upload a media file (multipart) | `upload_media` |
| `GET` | `/media/{media_id}` | Retrieve a media asset | — |
| `GET` | `/media` | List media assets (filter, paginate) | — |
| `POST` | `/mcp` | JSON-RPC 2.0 endpoint for MCP clients | — |

All write endpoints accept `idempotency_key` (or `Idempotency-Key` header) for safe retries.

### MCP Tools

The MCP server lives at `POST {APP_URL}/api/v1/mcp` and speaks JSON-RPC 2.0 over Streamable HTTP. It implements the standard `initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`, and `ping` methods. Tools:

| Tool | Purpose | Permission |
|---|---|---|
| `list_accounts` | List social accounts this API key can act on | — |
| `create_draft` | Create a draft post (caption, title, media, first comment, optional proposed publish time) | `create_posts` |
| `schedule_post` | Create and schedule a post in one step | `create_posts` + `publish_directly` |
| `schedule_draft` | Schedule an existing draft | `create_posts` + `publish_directly` |
| `get_post` | Retrieve a post with aggregate status and per-platform state | — |
| `list_posts` | List posts newest-first, with optional status filter and cursor pagination | — |
| `cancel_post` | Revert a scheduled post back to draft | `create_posts` |
| `search_media` | Find media assets by query, type, tags, or folder | — |
| `get_media` | Retrieve a single media asset by ID | — |
| `upload_media` | Upload a small base64-encoded file (≤ 1 MB raw). For larger files, use REST `POST /media`. | `upload_media` |
| `get_account_analytics` | Channel analytics over a rolling 7–90 day window | `view_analytics` |
| `get_post_analytics` | Per-platform metrics for a single post (safe for polling drafts) | `view_analytics` |
| `list_inbox_messages` | List comments, mentions, DMs, reviews on allowlisted accounts; filter by status, type, sentiment, `unanswered_only` | `use_inbox` |
| `get_inbox_message` | One inbox item with its parent, replies, internal notes, and the post it was left on | `use_inbox` |
| `list_saved_replies` | The workspace's canned replies | `use_inbox` |
| `reply_to_inbox_message` | Send a reply/DM through the platform API and record it | `reply_from_inbox` |
| `triage_inbox_message` | Set status/sentiment and attach an internal note without replying | `use_inbox` (+ `reply_from_inbox` for notes) |
| `list_ideas` | Idea-board cards not yet turned into posts; pass `idea_id` to `create_draft` to link them | `create_posts` |
| `get_schedule` | Posting slots plus every planned post in a window (max 31 days), to find gaps | — |
| `submit_for_approval` | Move a draft to `pending_review` and notify approvers | `create_posts` |
| `notify_team` | Notify the key's issuer and every approver/manager: `kind=decision` or `kind=digest` | — |
| `get_workspace_policy` | The workspace's agent autonomy level, approval mode, timezone, and what this key may do | — |

### Connecting an MCP client

The server is at `{APP_URL}/api/v1/mcp` and supports two authentication modes — pick whichever your client uses.

**Claude Desktop (and other native OAuth connectors).** In Claude Desktop open **Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector**, name it, and enter the server URL `{APP_URL}/api/v1/mcp`. Claude registers itself (Dynamic Client Registration) and opens a browser to log in to Osir AI and approve access — **no API key required**. Any Studio user can connect; the connection acts with **their own** workspace permissions (read-only roles get the read tools, while posting/scheduling/uploading require the matching permission), operating on their last-active workspace. Requires Studio to be served over a public **https** URL.

**Claude Code, Cursor, custom agents (static API key).** Point the client at the same URL and send an API key as a Bearer token (`Authorization: Bearer bb_studio_...`). For Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http osir_ai {APP_URL}/api/v1/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer bb_studio_..."
```

## Autopilot Agent (Strands + AgentCore)

`agent/` contains a Strands Agents SDK agent that drives Studio through the MCP tools above. Three scheduled loops:

- **Inbox** (every 15 min): replies to routine questions with the team's saved replies, resolves spam, and escalates anything negative, sensitive, or ambiguous with an internal note and a `notify_team` decision.
- **Calendar** (daily): finds posting slots with nothing planned, turns an unused idea card into a draft in the brand voice, and submits it for approval. It cannot publish.
- **Digest** (weekly): analytics, inbox volume, next week's gaps, three recommendations, delivered as a notification that respects quiet hours.
- **Command** (on demand): "plan next week for LinkedIn", "schedule this Thursday at 9", "how did the launch post do".

How much it may do is a per-workspace dial in Settings → Approvals (`off`, `draft_only`, `autopilot`); the agent reads it via the `get_workspace_policy` tool and only ever sees the scheduling tools when the dial, the approval workflow, and the API key all allow it.

```bash
cd agent && pip install -r requirements.txt
STUDIO_URL=http://localhost:8000 STUDIO_API_KEY=bb_studio_... python run_local.py inbox --dry-run
```

Deployment to Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime with EventBridge Scheduler triggers is documented in [agent/README.md](agent/README.md), together with the architecture diagram.

### Web UI (`web/`)

The Next.js/TypeScript frontend. It is the app: calendar, inbox, analytics, approvals, channels, workspace / organization / team / API-key settings, account and notifications, plus the autopilot console (what the agent did, what it needs you to decide, a command box, the autonomy dial). It signs you in with the Django session and reads Studio through `/api/web/` (session-authenticated) and `/api/v1/agent/*`. The composer, media library and the public pages (login, signup, OAuth connect, client portal) are still Django templates, proxied under the same origin while they migrate. See [web/README.md](web/README.md).

```bash
cd web && cp .env.example .env.local && npm install && npm run dev   # http://localhost:3000 (needs Studio on :8000)
python agent/run_local.py worker                                     # executes commands typed in the console
```

## Troubleshooting

**Docker: `postgres` container is unhealthy**
Wait 10-15 seconds after `docker compose up` for the health check to pass, then retry your command. Check logs with `docker compose logs postgres`.

**`python manage.py migrate` fails with connection errors**
Make sure PostgreSQL is running and healthy. For Docker: `docker compose ps` should show postgres as "healthy". For local: verify the `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` matches your setup.

**Tailwind CSS changes not appearing**
Make sure the Tailwind watcher is running: `cd theme/static_src && npm run start`. If styles still don't update, try `npm run build` for a full rebuild.

**OAuth callback errors ("redirect URI mismatch")**
The redirect URI registered on the platform must exactly match `{APP_URL}/social-accounts/callback/{platform}/`. Check that `APP_URL` in `.env` matches the URL you're accessing (including `http` vs `https` and port number).

**Threads: "No app ID was provided in the request" (error `4476002`)**
Threads uses its own App ID, not the Facebook one. Set `PLATFORM_THREADS_APP_ID` / `PLATFORM_THREADS_APP_SECRET` from **Use cases → Access the Threads API → Settings**, and register `{APP_URL}/social-accounts/callback/threads/` in that same panel — the Facebook Login redirect URI list does not cover Threads. See the [Meta](#meta-facebook-instagram-threads) section.

**Background tasks not running (posts not publishing)**
Make sure the worker is running: `python manage.py process_tasks`. In Docker: check `docker compose logs worker`.
